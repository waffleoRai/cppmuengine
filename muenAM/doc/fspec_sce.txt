Binary Scene Script Specifications
Version 1.0.0
April 3, 2021

=========================== _SCE (.musce) Format ===========================
TGI table at top to assign 32-bit aliases to full TGIs ao don't have to write TGIs as parameters.
Top bit of alias is set when table index is expected.

=========================== Events ===========================

Commands start with 1 byte to identify command (will extend to 2 bytes if I need to in a newer version)

-- Audio
Works on midi-like logic. Sounds are played and stopped on channel-layers. Further effects/controls added to channels (like volume, pan, filters etc.)
There are 16 mono channels (0-15), 16 stereo channels (16-31), and 4 seqsynth channels (further split into 16 sub-channels for MIDI, invisible to the SCE reader)

PLAY_SOUND [a0]
	-> Text syntax
		PLAY_SOUND (source) (tbl_idx if appl.) (channel) (input vol 0-127 optional) (loop - if arg not specified, default to false)
		PLAY_SOUND my_sfx SE_CH_2 vol=120 loop=false
PLAY_RANDOM_SOUND [a9]
	-> PLAY_RANDOM_SOUND (pool size) (source0) (idx0) (source1) (idx1)... (channel) (vol=n) (loop=false)
STOP_SOUND [a1]
SET_VOL [a2] //Can also specify second arg for time to get to that volume
	-> SET_VOL channel vol (millis)
SET_PAN [a3]
RESET_SOUND [a6]
FADEOUT_ALL [a7] (Basically a shortcut for vol reduction - text only)
FADEOUT_CH [a8] (Basically a shortcut for vol reduction - text only)
	-> FADEOUT_CH ch (millis)

LOAD_SOUNDBANK [a4]
PLAY_SEQ [a5]

-- Visual
There are 128 image layers (in 2D). Informally, groups are assigned to various functions such as background near the bottom and UI near the top.

DRAW_2D (this includes static images or animations - can specify parameter to draw with effect)
	flags (1)
		0-1: Transition type
			0 - None (instant draw)
			1 - Basic crossfade in (param is 4-bytes # of millis) (CROSSFADE)
			2 - Effects table entry (param is 4 bytes for tbl ID, 4 bytes for index) (FROMTBL)
			3 - Callback (param is 4 bytes for function id, 2 for func param count, then 8*2 for function params. If callback, asset/idx not specified) (CALLBACK)
	asset (4)
	index if appl. (4)
	layer (2)
	x offset (2)
	y offset (2)
	transition - if present, meaning specified by flags (4-8). Defaults to none/instant
	-> Text syntax
		DRAW_2D asset_name tbl_idx layer pos=x,y transition=type,param...
FILL_2D (fill with solid color on some layer)
	Same as draw 2D, but takes a 32-bit color instead of an asset reference. (also takes transition effects)
SET_OPACITY (of layer)
MOVE_2D (move contents of layer to another part of screen)
	-> MOVE_2D x,y (rotate=n)
CLEAR_LAYER (can specify parameter to undraw with effect? - or maybe I'll make that its own command)
SHOW_TXB (draw textbox)
SET_TXB_VIS (sets visibility of textbox or textbox module)
CLEAR_TXB
SET_TEXT
APPEND_TEXT
	-> APPEND_TEXT (textbox) (module) (table) (index)
TXB_NEWLINE

STD_EFFECT	(Do a built-in effect, these can be added as needed.)
	SHAKE (shakes the screen or only specific layers at requested depth/freq/dur)
	-> SHAKE (#times) (millis per shake) (pixels moved) (direction enum - x,y,xy) (layer(s) comma delim, all if not specified)
	MONOCHROME (arg can be "sepia" "on" "off" or a hex color)
	NEGA (arg "on" or "off")

PLAY_MOV
STOP_MOV

-- Misc

WAIT [10]
CALL_METHOD [11]
	Method ID - Matched to void(uint64_t*) call by running program (4)
	Number of parameters (2)
WAIT_FOR [12] (Async block until specified condition is met)
DELAY [13] - Delays next command for n millis

FOR/ENDFOR
	-> FOR st ed
	-> FOR <varname> st ed
	"Compiler" determines which version by arg count
WHILE/ENDWHILE
IF/ENDIF
